### Stages
Reportables are essential

#### Deadlines
- April 28th: Presentation day
- Reporting: We will have a client, Dr. Benson/ student services

Backstory in lecture

## Questions & Details

### Client summary:
The client wants something inspired by Assassin or geocaching meant to help build community, inspire collaboration, and foster belonging in the Engineering field. The product must be mentally stimulating for a wide audience, for the experienced and new alike. It must build tension to inspire cooperation. 

### Questions to the Client
Budget constraints -

- If items are hidden/ places around campus, is permission needed? Should processes be put in place in case of theft/ tampering? -

- JUST digital or technological? Or mixed? -there’s four of you, you can do a mix

- What is an acceptable example of a prize? -Something appropriate for the school or the program, like a 30 buck Arduino, something to help them grow

### Questions from Other Groups
- How competitive? -Decently, but not enough to interfere w/ schooling

- How technological? -Decent enough, everyone’s an engineer

- How much time throughout play should it take? -once or twice a week, during lunch break type of thing. I want people to get out and build community

- Would it be between ALL Engineering students or just entry level? -Mostly towards entry level students, but don’t exclude upper level

- What kind of longevity do you want? Will you want to be in charge or just responsible? -I want it self-sustaining, but in the loop?

- Can we include elements from an existing event, IE geocaching? -You can BUILD on an existing concept, but I don’t want it linked to Geocache app.

### Deeper Client Questions:
- Smaller close connections or large general community? -Small, close connections, “I have a couple people that I’m close to now.”

### Other Groups Follow Up
- Specific memory that comes to mind? -Little puzzles, passed around a room. It was disappointing: nothing past “It was cute” I want engineering
